Roadmap
.......

There is a road map with releases and changes in each release.

Releases have associated a date and can be eventually closed, when they contain enough changes for the current resources.

The way to modify the roadmap is through the feature request tracker.

Feature request tracker
.......................

- Centralized way to share new functionalities and find common interests

- Every functionality will be evaluated technically in terms of cost of development and convenience with the general objectives of the project

Bug tracker
...........

EXPLAIN

Mailing list
............

Where technical decisions will take place publicly so that they are documented in the future. Eventually, developers may have chats that will be dumped to the list.
