UNREDD NFMS Portal
==================

General objectives
------------------

REDD requirements.

Country technological independence:

* Open source

* Easy to learn

Roadmap
-------

The roadmap contains a list of the aproximated deadlines where the different versions of the software will be 
delivered, along with the functionalities they will include.

Each release can be open or closed. When open, the deadline can be moved and the list of functionalities can
be changed by discussing with the development team. Once the development is started the deadline is
closed and no more changes are allowed: the deadline is fixed and it is not possible to include new functionalities.

The current roadmap can be found here: https://github.com/nfms4redd/nfms/blob/master/roadmap.txt

Procedures
----------

The following sections explain the procedures to interact with the project to have new features implemented.

### Feature request tracker

A feature request tracker provides a centralized way to manage the requests for new functionalities on the
portal. Associated with each feature request there is a space for communication and discussion so it is
an interesting tool for collaboration and finding common interests in the context of the portal.

Feature requests can eventually become part of the roadmap if the discussion leads to this outcome. On the
other side, if the feature is not seen as interesting in the discussion it may be dropped. For having
one of these outcomes, every functionality must be evaluated technically in terms of cost of development 
and maintenance and in terms of convenience related to the general objectives of the project.

In our case the feature request of the NFMS portal can be found here: https://github.com/nfms4redd/nfms/issues.

The way to start a discussion to include a new functionality is to create an issue. If the issue is 
already created, it is possible to add new comments asking for the functionality to be included in the next release.

### Mailing list

Where technical decisions will take place publicly so that they are documented in the future. Eventually, 
developers may have chats that will be dumped to the list.
